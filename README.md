# Wine Quality Prediction
This repository contains a project that demonstrates how to predict the quality of wines using the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm. The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of different wines, such as acidity, pH levels, and alcohol content, along with a quality rating. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify wines into different quality categories based on these attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a collection of wine samples, each with various chemical properties and a quality rating. The dataset is divided into red and white wines, and the goal is to predict the quality of these wines based on their attributes.

## Training
In this project, we use the K-NN algorithm, which does not involve traditional model training as seen in other machine learning algorithms. Instead, the algorithm stores the entire dataset in memory and makes predictions based on the closest neighbors at prediction time.

## Evaluation
The performance of the K-NN model is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts the quality of wines based on the provided attributes.
